# Agent Instructions

When creating a new story, follow these steps:

1. Create a temporary folder such as `temp/<story-name>` at the repository root.
2. Inside this folder create `brainstorm.md` to explore initial story ideas, themes, and potential plot directions.
3. Create `characters.md` to define key characters with detailed backgrounds, motivations, and arcs.
4. Inside this folder create an `outline.md` summarizing the major plot points.
5. Draft each chapter as separate files (`chapter1.txt`, `chapter2.txt`, etc.) in the temp folder.
6. Each chapter should be at least 10 pages long (approximately 2,500 words) to properly convey a full scene and move the story forward. Avoid overly short chapters that don't give enough depth and development.
7. After drafting all chapters, concatenate them in order into `stories/<story-name>.txt`.
8. Only commit the final file in `stories/`. Do not commit the temporary folder or intermediate files.

## Tips for Writing Audiobook Content
- Maintain a clear narrative arc (beginning, middle, end).
- Use vivid descriptions and consistent characters and voice.
- End chapters with a hook to keep listeners engaged.
- Aim for prose that sounds natural when read aloud.
- Avoid complex sentence structures that could confuse listeners.
- Use dialogue tags consistently to help listeners track conversations.
- Include natural pauses and breaks in the narrative flow.
- Minimize use of parentheticals and footnotes.
- Choose words that are clear and easy to pronounce.
- Vary sentence length and rhythm to maintain interest.
- Use sensory details to help listeners visualize scenes.
- Keep track of character voices and speech patterns.
- Read drafts aloud to test flow and pacing.

## General Guidelines
- dont orient on the other stories, just write the story you want to write as good as you can.
