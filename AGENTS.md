# Agent Instructions

When creating a new story, follow these steps:

1. Create a temporary folder such as `temp/<story-name>` at the repository root.
2. Inside this folder create `brainstorm.md` to explore initial story ideas, themes, and potential plot directions.
3. Create `characters.md` to define key characters with detailed backgrounds, motivations, and arcs.
4. Inside this folder create an `outline.md` summarizing the major plot points.
5. Draft each chapter as separate files (`chapter1.txt`, `chapter2.txt`, etc.) in the temp folder.
6. **MINIMUM LENGTH REQUIREMENTS**: Each chapter MUST be at least 15-20 pages long (approximately 4,000-5,000 words minimum) to properly convey a full scene and move the story forward. **This is a hard requirement - do not write shorter chapters.**
7. **TARGET STORY LENGTH**: Aim for stories that are 50,000-80,000 words total (20-30 chapters of substantial length). This ensures a full, satisfying narrative experience.
8. After drafting all chapters, concatenate them in order into `stories/<story-name>.txt`.
9. Only commit the final file in `stories/`. Do not commit the temporary folder or intermediate files.

## CRITICAL: How to Write Detailed, Long-Form Content

### Scene Development (ESSENTIAL)
- **Expand every scene**: Don't just tell what happens - show it in rich detail
- **Set the scene**: Spend 2-3 paragraphs describing the environment, atmosphere, lighting, sounds, smells
- **Character interactions**: Include full conversations with natural back-and-forth dialogue
- **Internal thoughts**: Show characters' internal monologue and emotional responses
- **Action sequences**: Break down actions into detailed, moment-by-moment descriptions
- **Transitions**: Don't jump between scenes - include travel time, preparation, aftermath

### Character Development Requirements
- **Deep character exploration**: Spend significant time on character backgrounds, motivations, fears, and desires
- **Character growth**: Show gradual character development throughout the story
- **Relationships**: Develop complex relationships between characters with detailed interactions
- **Unique voices**: Each character should have distinct speech patterns and perspectives

### Pacing and Structure
- **Slow build**: Don't rush plot points - let tension build naturally over multiple chapters
- **Subplots**: Include 2-3 meaningful subplots that weave through the main narrative
- **World-building**: If applicable, spend significant time establishing the world/setting
- **Backstory**: Gradually reveal character and world history through the narrative

### Writing Techniques for Length and Detail
- **Show, don't tell**: Instead of "John was angry," write 2-3 paragraphs showing his anger through actions, dialogue, body language
- **Sensory details**: Include what characters see, hear, smell, feel, taste in every scene
- **Emotional depth**: Explore characters' emotional responses to events in detail
- **Multiple perspectives**: Consider showing important events from different characters' viewpoints
- **Consequences**: Show the aftermath and ripple effects of major events

## Tips for Writing Audiobook Content
- Maintain a clear narrative arc (beginning, middle, end) across the full story length
- Use vivid descriptions and consistent characters and voice throughout
- End chapters with strong hooks to keep listeners engaged across longer content
- Aim for prose that sounds natural when read aloud for extended periods
- Avoid complex sentence structures that could confuse listeners during long listening sessions
- Use dialogue tags consistently to help listeners track conversations
- Include natural pauses and breaks in the narrative flow for pacing
- Minimize use of parentheticals and footnotes
- Choose words that are clear and easy to pronounce
- Vary sentence length and rhythm to maintain interest across long chapters
- Use sensory details extensively to help listeners visualize scenes
- Keep track of character voices and speech patterns consistently
- Read drafts aloud to test flow and pacing across the full story

## General Guidelines
- **Priority is LENGTH and DETAIL**: Always err on the side of more content rather than less
- Don't orient on the other stories, just write the story you want to write as comprehensively as you can
- **Minimum viable story**: No story should be less than 40,000 words total
- **Chapter minimums are non-negotiable**: If a chapter feels complete but is under 4,000 words, it's not complete enough - expand it
- Think of this as writing a full novel, not a short story or novella
