# Agent Instructions

When creating a new story, follow these steps:

1. Create a temporary folder such as `temp/<story-name>` at the repository root.
2. Inside this folder create an `outline.md` summarizing the major plot points.
3. Draft each chapter as separate files (`chapter1.txt`, `chapter2.txt`, etc.) in the temp folder.
4. Each chapter should be at least 10 pages long (approximately 2,500 words) to properly convey a full scene and move the story forward. Avoid overly short chapters that don't give enough depth and development.
5. After drafting all chapters, concatenate them in order into `stories/<story-name>.txt`.
6. Only commit the final file in `stories/`. Do not commit the temporary folder or intermediate files.

## Tips for Writing Audiobook Content
- Maintain a clear narrative arc (beginning, middle, end).
- Use vivid descriptions and consistent characters and voice.
- End chapters with a hook to keep listeners engaged.
- Aim for prose that sounds natural when read aloud.
